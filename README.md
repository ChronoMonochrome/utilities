utilities for Linux kernel

unpack_initramfs.py

Based on updated script found at http://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/index.php?title=Extract_initramfs_from_zImage
The problem that it work too slow :)

How to use this script: 
type via terminal:

./unpack_initramfs.py boot.img

It will work only with gzip'd kernels with uncompressed ramdisk.
